/*
 * 
 * Created by George R Canepa 1/25/21
 * Needed a project to practice using GitHub repository
 * Use as is, no restrictions, not warranty is provided
 * Just remember that you get what you pay for
 * 
 * TOF10120 is a good little sensor, but I could not find much I2C reference code other than the basic distance read
 * At some point I want to use a few in the same application, so need to be able to read multiple sensors on the same I2C bus
 * 
 * I ended up having to dechiper the Chinese in the datasheet (Google translate is amazing for this)
 * and figured out how to do all the I2C read/write commands. Not all versions of the datasheet online have the I2C table
 * I posted the version I used in the documents folder of this repository (listed below)
 * 
 * Surprised as to how some of the online reviews comparing this sensor to the Ultra Sound sensors did not recognize 
 * how much better this sensor is
 * 
 * I use it for my Robot, and it does an excellent job detecting walls, not matter at what angle
 * Ultra Sound sensors are useless when you approach the wall at an angle
 * 
 * This sensor can also be calibrated, making it extremly accurate
 * 
 * This code was created from my robot control code (for my own reference, as this reference code is not public)
 * "C:\Users\georg\Documents\Arduino\sketch-8266-Motor-VoltMeter-Rev1.3\sketch-8266-Motor-VoltMeter-Rev1.3.ino"
  - Changed to TOF10120
  - disabled checkWifi and checkondistance and any ultrasound call
  - Not getting data from the TOF10120, need to check on a scope (do I need the 10K pull up resistors? no)
  - Got it working with UART mode
  - Eventually got it working with I2C. Created a Git repository https://github.com/grcanepa/TOF10120 with the TOG10120 specific code
*  
* Rev 0.0
*   Initial rev
*   Includes an I2C scanner (in case you need a scanner to find the device)
*   Has code to write deviation and I2C address, but not active by default (writing is to EEprom and there is a cycle limit on EEprom)
*   
*   Code to set a new i2c address 
    *  Does to a new value of: 0xA8 which is 0x54 (b7-b1) which is 84 (int) value given to Wire.beginTransmission(i2c_Address);
    *  From a default i2c_Address of 82 (0xA4 which is 0x52 (b7-b1) which is what shows on an i2c scanner
* 
*   Has code to do all the read operations (RealTime and Filtered Data, Data Deviation, Various Data send/Receive modes, and I2C address)
*   The GitHub repository has the original Chinese version of the datasheet, and other notes I have captured along the way
*   In case you got the code from another source, my original version of this code is at: https://github.com/grcanepa/TOF10120
*  
*   I included some UART code that I had developed to use the UART mode (default read only)
*   I posted this primarily for the I2C code, as I could not find any I2C write code online
*   
*   I did get 3 sensors on the same bus one at 0x52, another at 0x53 and the third at 0x54
